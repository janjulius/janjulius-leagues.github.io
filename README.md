# Big league plans

## Relics (probably)
<details>
<summary>Relics</summary>

## T1 
**Animal Wrangler** (Best for pvm, chins/cooked food when fishing)<br>

Power Miner

Lumberjack

## T? (teleport)
**Clue Compass**

Fairy's Flight/Bank Heist

## T? (recall/note)
if no relics with increased farming/food
maybe total recall

else bankers note

## T? Grimoire vs Overgrown
Very much depends on if spellbooks are necessary for build, imo, thralls and veng/barrage wont do much unless mage build

When it comes to prayers, also, combat relics will make you so overpowered that the prayer increase may be negligible.

Still also an unrevealed 3rd relic.

## T? Utility tier
**Dodgy Deals** OR **Friendly Forager**

Corner cutter is kind of usless unless money is needed but Golden god could be taken for this, no other relics revealed in that tier though.
